        <h1>CHANGES</h1>
        <h4>By 2Pac</h4>
        <p>Come on come on I see no changes. Wake up in the morning and I ask myself, "Is life worth living? Should I blast myself?<br> I'm tired of bein' poor and even worse I'm black. My stomach hurts, so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch. Cops give a damn about a negro? Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero.</p>
        <p>Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares? One less hungry mouth on the welfare. First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers. Give 'em guns, step back, and watch 'em kill each other. "It's time to fight back", that's what Huey said. 2 shots in the dark now Huey's dead.</p>
        <p>2 shots in the dark now Huey's dead. I got love for my brother, but we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other. We gotta start makin' changes. Learn to see me as a brother 'stead of 2 distant strangers. And that's how it's supposed to be.l</p>
        <p>How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me? I'd love to go back to when we played as kids but things changed, and that's the way it is</span>
